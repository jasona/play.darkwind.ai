# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with
code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Darkflow, the web-based WebSocket client for the Darkwind LDMud game server
(play.darkwind.ai). The client connects to the MUD via WebSocket using the
browser-native `WebSocket` API. It supports GMCP over binary WebSocket frames
for structured data (panels, mapping, IDE, server-driven windows).

## Architecture

- **Modular vanilla JS** -- native ES modules, no build tools, no frameworks, no
  client-side dependencies
- **Product identity** -- visible client branding and `Core.Hello.client`
  identify the app as Darkflow; existing `Darkwind.*` GMCP package names remain
  protocol-stable
- Express server serves static files from `public/` in development and
  `dist/client/` in built mode; does not proxy WebSocket traffic
- The LDMud driver auto-detects WebSocket connections on the same port as telnet
  (no separate WS port)
- Text frames carry commands (client->server) and game output (server->client)
  as plain UTF-8 strings
- Binary frames carry GMCP messages (bidirectional) for structured data
- ANSI SGR escape sequences in output are parsed and rendered as styled HTML
  spans
- 32x32 graphical tile map built collaboratively from all players' exploration
  data

## Key Modules

- `gmcp.js` -- GMCP event bus, handshake, send/receive
- `ansi.js` -- Stateful ANSI parser (handles partial sequences across messages)
- `output.js` -- Terminal output with requestAnimationFrame batching
- `panel-manager.js` -- Panel lifecycle, drag/drop, edge snapping, GMCP data
  handlers
- `panel-renderers.js` -- Render functions for each panel type
- `map-data-v2.js` -- Server-authoritative map model (MapData2): room graph +
  coords from the server, sync/version reconciliation, browse-area store
- `map-renderer.js` -- CSS Grid tile map renderer (32x32 terrain tiles)
- `window-manager.js` -- Server-driven GUI window rendering (Darkwind.Window)
- `ide-manager.js` / `ide-editor.js` -- In-browser code editor (Darkwind.IDE)
- `combat-stage-renderer.mjs` -- Canvas combat stage behind the Combat panel's renderer contract; falls back to `combat-visual-renderer.mjs` without a 2D canvas
- `combat-stage.mjs` / `combat-stage-core.mjs` -- Canvas combat stage (tokens, backdrop, per-event effects); core is pure and unit-tested
- `combat-rig-core.mjs` -- Procedural fighter rig for the stage: figure resolution (equipment or guild weapon, race scale, NPC beast), poses, and joint geometry; pure and unit-tested
- `combat-equipment-core.mjs` -- Equipment profile from Char.Items (hands, shield, helmet, armor) with a keyword weapon classifier; pure and unit-tested
- `combat-sprites.mjs` / `combat-sprite-bake.mjs` -- Sprite sheet manifest, loader (character, then gender-race, then gender-family such as male-human, then kind), and placement for the stage figures (see `docs/combat-sprites.md`); bake tool renders a sheet from the rig or a registered style
- `combat-sprite-art.mjs` -- Hand-authored vector bodies drawn over rig geometry for specific sheets (e.g. `male-scro`); used only while baking
- `scripts/sprite-sheet-split.py` / `scripts/sprite-sheet-assemble.py` / `scripts/comfyui-sprite-cell.json` -- Sprite paint-over pipeline: split a generated sheet into per-pose frames, assemble painted frames and scale the manifest; ComfyUI single-cell ControlNet graph

## GMCP Extensions

See [`docs/gmcp-darkwind-index.md`](docs/gmcp-darkwind-index.md) for the full,
handshake-aligned protocol catalog. Major extensions include:

- `Darkwind.Window 1` -- Server-driven modals, panels, and forms
- `Darkwind.IDE 2` -- In-browser LPC editor with single-frame and chunked
  transfers
- `Darkwind.MapData2 2` -- Server-authoritative mapping, browse, reset, and
  error flow

The V1 `Darkwind.MapData` package is retired and documented only for migration.

## Server-Side Companion (darkwind-nextgen)

The MUD server codebase is at `../darkwind-nextgen/`. Key server-side files for
this client:

- `secure/daemons/telopt_d.c` -- GMCP message sending (Room.Info, MapData.Area,
  Window, IDE)
- `secure/player/telopt.c` -- GMCP message receiving and dispatch
- `secure/daemons/map2_d.c` -- Mapping daemon (MapData2: shared room graph,
  incremental sticky coordinate placement; legacy `map_d.c` is the retired V1)
- `secure/include/gmcp_defs.h` -- GMCP package/key constants
- `secure/daemons/vrroom.c` -- Virtual room mapping support (query_map_id,
  query_map_exit_path)

## Key Design Constraints

- Never use non-ASCII characters in any code files (LPC only supports ASCII, and
  this has caused server crashes)
- Typia validators must live in `.ts` modules; `@ttsc/unplugin` transforms only
  `/\.[cm]?tsx?$/` and does not transform Svelte `<script>` blocks
- The driver source is at `../ldmud/`
- GMCP is delivered via binary WebSocket frames, not telnet subnegotiation
- Must handle partial ANSI sequences spanning message boundaries
- Batch DOM updates via requestAnimationFrame to handle rapid server messages
- Target browsers: Chrome 111+, Edge 111+, Firefox 114+, Safari 16.4+ (Vite 8
  `baseline-widely-available` default)
- Tile assets served from `public/assets/tiles/` (22 terrain JPGs + 1 player
  PNG)
- `@ttsc/unplugin` hashes every non-ignored file under the repository root for
  each transform validation. Development relocates `DARKFLOW_LOG_DIR` so proxy
  logs do not invalidate that hash.
- All WebSocket upgrade routing goes through the dispatcher in `server.js`. The
  proxy `WebSocketServer` uses `noServer`; a path-bound server aborts every
  other upgrade with HTTP 400.
- Playwright specs live in `e2e/`, never under `test/`, because `node --test`
  discovers files under a `test/` directory.
- `/mcp` mounts only when `mud-test-mcp` dependencies are installed. Root-level
  `npm ci` does not install those dependencies.
- ESLint and Prettier cover the Phase 0 and root bootstrap TypeScript, Svelte,
  and browser-test surface plus their configuration files. Run `npm run lint` and
  `npm run format:check` before committing.
- Legacy JavaScript, including `server.js`, `lib/`, `desktop/`, and `public/`,
  is outside the formatter boundary. Preserve each legacy file's existing
  style; do not mass-format it.
- Use the exact toolchain in `.nvmrc`: Node 22.15.0 with npm 10.9.2. Run
  `nvm use && npm ci`; `engine-strict=true` rejects dependency changes made
  with another version.
